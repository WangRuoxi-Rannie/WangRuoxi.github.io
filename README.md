My name is Wang Ruoxi, a Master's student in Applied Economics with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics, specializing in data analysis and economic research. I have gained industry research experience at Cinda Securities, where I authored in-depth reports, conducted financial data analysis, and compiled key meeting summaries. At OUTPUT, a new media company, I was responsible for data analytics, brand promotion, and public relations, optimizing media strategies and driving significant traffic growth.  

I also have experience in game development, having served as the lead narrative and numerical planner for a Tencent Games project, where I played a key role in designing and launching a minigame. Additionally, during my internship as a data analyst at Yunnan Olightek Opto-Electronic Technology, I worked on production data integration, conducted quality analysis, and proposed process improvements that enhanced product qualification rates.  

Proficient in Python, R, and SQL, I excel in market research, data extraction, and visualization. I have led interdisciplinary research projects on global happiness, gender income disparities, and carbon emissions. With strong analytical skills, multitasking abilities, and fluency in both Chinese and English, I am committed to leveraging data-driven insights to support business and economic decision-making.
